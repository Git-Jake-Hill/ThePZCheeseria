# The PZ Cheeseria

As an MVP of our cheeseria, we are looking to display our cheese selection that can be purchased in-store.

## Description

-   Front-end React
-   Back-end NodeJS
-   Database SQLite (in memory storage for proof of concept - can replace with a cloud database for persistent storage)
-   Unit Test Jest

## Getting Started

### Executing program

-   Build and run front-end and back-end with Docker

`docker-compose up --build`

-   Build and run individually

-   Back-end

`CD back-end`

`npm install`

`npm start`

-   Front-end

`CD front-end`

`npm install`

`npm start`

### Running Tests

`CD back-end`

`npm test`

### API Docs

-   Run the back-end server

`CD back-end`

`npm install`

`npm start`

```
API Docs available at http://localhost:5000/api-docs
```

## With more time

-   Front-end add functionality to create, update, delete cheese in the database.
-   Front-end build out pages, nav-bar etc.
-   Add additional Unit Tests to be more exhaustive.
-   Upgrade SQLite to a cloud database for persistent storage between sessions/users.
